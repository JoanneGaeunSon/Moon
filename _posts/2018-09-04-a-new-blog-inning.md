### Why are you like this?

If you follow me on social media, you may have noticed that I have been travelling quite a lot during my college years. In fact, by the time I return to school in January, I'll pretty much have spent an entire year away from school, due to my time in the UCDC program, as intern in the East Coast, and my study abroad program this Fall. 

Funnily enough, many people have expressed confusion as to where I am at, some believing that I have dropped out of college entirely, and others wondering if I hated my time at UCSD, as I spent so much time away from it. Both are not true- I'm finishing up my degree next Spring, as planned, and I actually truly loved my experience at UCSD. I myself questioned why I chose to leave my school, my friends, and my family so far behind, but in my opinion, to cultivate personal growth, it is important to put myself in unfamiliar and sometimes uncomfortable situations. It definitely is hard to uproot my life every three months, live in completely new environments, and constantly have to make new friends, but through these past few months, I have forged great relationships with amazing people, and broadened my view of of the world, as well as learned more about myself than I ever could have by staying within the confines of my comfort zone. 

### What is this blog even?

In the past, I recorded my adventures primarily using social media, but I received much encouragement from friends and family to go further and start a travel blog. I actually have loved writing from a young age, and I have a passion for photography, so starting a blog was right down my alley. Being a new blogger, I'm not too sure exactly what my posts will be about, so I'm super open to suggestions for content! If you know me, you will know that food porn, of course, will be ample!

This blog is also a web dev side project for my portfolio, so it will be a constant work in progress! I hope to further improve it and add more features as I go, so expect changes!

That being said, check out my first post about travelling: [Why I Always Choose the Window Seat](wanderso.me/why-i-always-choose-the-window-seat)
