As someone who has been on about twenty flights both domestic and international within the last year, I have consistently opted to sit in the window seat, if possible.

Twice I have been unsuccessful, and my flight experience was radically different as a result. 

Here are a couple of the reasons why I think the window seat is the best choice for any given flight.


## Reason #1: It's the window seat. (Duh)

Strictly speaking of visuals, the window seat is 100% the way to go. If you're sitting in an aisle seat, you get to see people shuffling down the aisle on the way to the bathroom. Honestly, that's a little too much information about total strangers that I don't need to know. If you sit in a middle seat, you get to see the back of the heads of the passengers in front of you, and possibly the occasional child peek over the seat head, although I guess it's fun to make goofy faces at them until they laugh ( I'm not speaking from experience at all ;) ). The aisle seat however... You get to see the world. Literally. 

When you're flying over water, you can scrutinize the vastness of the ocean, watching the waves undulate in a therapeutically rhythmic manner. 

When you're flying over land, you get to follow the crevices and peaks etched onto the surface beautiful Mother Earth. You get to see toy-sized cars on miniscule highways, wondering who is in them and where they are going. I love watching the world outside as if it is a tiny world that I'm far removed from. At night, you get to see the twinkling lights of cities below, and the concentrations of brightly lit buildings contrasting the vast blackness of the contryside.


My favorite moments in air was on a flight from the South Africa to Qatar where the sun was setting and we were literally chasing the sunset. Because of the direction I was going in, and the timing of the flight, I got to see the gorgeous orange, pink, and red hues of the sky for a good 30 minutes. 

Also, not to be morbid, but in the slight possiblity that the airplane crashes, which of the three types of views would you prefer as the last thing you see before you perish? 

Also, who doesn't like a good old fashioned Instagram post from an airplane window with a profound quote about travelling as the caption?

## Reason #2: That awkward moment when you rest your head on a stranger's shoulder.
Also not speaking from experience. Alright you got me. It was on a flight from Washington DC to San Francisco. My flight was at 6am, so I had to get up at 3am to get to the aiport on time. Needless to say, I was exhausted. It was a full flight, and due to forgetting to check in, I was put in one of the last availible seats- a middle seat near the very back. Armed with my eye mask , wireless headphones, and simp playlist on Spotify, I was determined to reclaim the sleep that had been so coldly robbed from me.
