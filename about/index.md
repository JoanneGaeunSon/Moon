## About Me

<center> {% capture image %}( https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/img/aboutme.jpg) {% endcapture %}  </center>

Hi Everyone! I'm Joanne, a current senior in college who is a globetrotter-in-training! 

I am a Cognitive Science major specializing in Human Computer Interaction, so this blog serves both as a side project and a way for me to record and share my travels.

My hobbies include cooking, photography, eating, and travelling (of course), and you'll see a lot of those things on this blog :) 

Feel free to reach out to me via <u>joannegaeunson@gmail.com</u> for any inqueries or suggestions!
